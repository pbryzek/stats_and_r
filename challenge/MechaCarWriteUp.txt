Using the MechaCar_mpg.csv file, I utilzed the R script to determine the correlation between the variables 
in the .CSV and the MPG for all 50 vehicle models listed. The variables contained were: Vehicle Length, Vehicle Weight, Spoiler Angle, 
Ground Clearance, Vehicle AWD, and Vehicle MPG. I took the MPG column and compared it to each variable listed to get the correlation factor r.

Correlation of MPG to other Variables
"MPG to Vehicle Length: r=0.61 Absolute val of r=0.61"
"MPG to Vehicle Weight: r=0.09 Absolute val of r=0.09"
"MPG to Spoiler Angle: r=-0.02 Absolute val of r=0.02"
"MPG to Ground Clearance: r=0.33 Absolute val of r=0.33"
"MPG to Vehicle AWD: r=-0.14 Absolute val of r=0.14"

Using the following chart for reference:
Absolute Value of r 	Strength of Correlation
r < 0.3 	               None or very weak
0.3 ≤ r < 0.5 	          Weak
0.5 ≤ r < 0.7 	          Moderate
r ≥ 0.7 	               Strong

We can determine the following correlations: 
1) A Moderate correlation between MPG and Vehicle Length
2) A Very Weak correlation between MPG and Vehicle Weight
3) A Very Weak correlation between MPG and Spoiler Angle
4) A Weak correlation between MPG and Ground Clearance
5) A Very Weak correlation between MPG and AWD

From that analysis, we can say that only Vehicle Length has a moderate correlation with MPG, meaning there is a moderate correlation as vehicle length increases, 
MPG increases and likewise as the length decreases the MPG decreases. Ground Clearance and MPG demonstrate a Weak correlation, and all other variables demonstrate a 
Very Weak correlation related to a vehicle's MPG.

I also produced correlation scatter plots for each variable combination from ggplot and stored the graphs:
1) ./mpg_plots/mpg_length.png
2) ./mpg_plots/mpg_weight.png
3) ./mpg_plots/mpg_angle.png
4) ./mpg_plots/mpg_clearance.png
5) ./mpg_plots/mpg_awd.png

I then ran the lm function calls on each pair of variables to the MPG. 

lm(formula = vehicle.mpg ~ vehicle.length, data = mechacar.mpg)
Coefficients:
   (Intercept)  vehicle.length  
       -25.062           4.673  

lm(formula = vehicle.mpg ~ vehicle.weight, data = mechacar.mpg)
Coefficients:
   (Intercept)  vehicle.weight  
     4.042e+01       7.649e-04  

lm(formula = vehicle.mpg ~ spoiler.angle, data = mechacar.mpg)
Coefficients:
  (Intercept)  spoiler.angle  
     46.07616       -0.01659  

lm(formula = vehicle.mpg ~ ground.clearance, data = mechacar.mpg)
Coefficients:
     (Intercept)  ground.clearance  
          19.418             2.022  

lm(formula = vehicle.mpg ~ vehicle.awd, data = mechacar.mpg)
Coefficients:
(Intercept)  vehicle.awd  
     47.313       -4.368  

From the linear regression models analyzed with respect to MPG for the vehicles, we can see that 

The following Linear Regression Model was created by combining all the variables and relating them to MPG in a single regression model.
lm(formula = mpg ~ vehicle.length + vehicle.weight + spoiler.angle + 
    ground.clearance + AWD, data = mechacar.mpg)

Residual standard error: 8.774 on 44 degrees of freedom
Multiple R-squared:  0.7149,	Adjusted R-squared:  0.6825 
F-statistic: 22.07 on 5 and 44 DF,  p-value: 5.35e-11

The output of the multiple linear regression model indicates the following equation for MPG:
MPG = -1.040e+02 + 6.267e+00(vehicle.length) + 1.245e-03(vehicle.weight) + 6.877e-02(spoiler.angle) + 3.546e+00(ground.clearance) + -3.411e+00(AWD)

As indicated from the individual linear regression model, the variables that have a slope farthest away from 0 are the ones with the 
strongest correlation: vehicle.length and ground.clearance. We also observe that only vehicle.length and ground.clearance are the variable represented that have 
Pr(>|t|) or p-value under the threshold of .05 meaning these are the only two that are statistically significant. As the other vars have p-values greater than .05, they 
are not considered statistically significant.

Based on the Multiple R-squared output of .7149, we can say that this model will accurately predict the MPG about 71.74% of the time. The overall p-value of the model is 5.35e-11 which is much smaller than the threshold value of .05, 
thus we can reject the null hypothesis and state that the slope of the model is not 0. 
This model indicates the problem of overfitting as the overall p-value is small but only 2 of the 5 variables analyzed are statistically significant meaning 
the data may fit well for this set but will not be a good indicator of future MPG prediction.

Next I open the Suspension_Coil.csv file to analyze the dataset contained here with a focus on the PSI represented across the vehicles.

From the t-test of the individual Lots with respect to PSI, we can see from Lot1,Lot2,Lot3 they p-values of 1, .6072, and .04168 respectively. 
Lots 1 and 2 represent high p-values which give us confidence that we can not reject the null hypothesis or in otherwords, weak evidence against the mu is 1500.
Lot3 on the other hand shows a p-value of .04168 which is under the threshold of .05 indicating strong evidence against the null hypothesis thus we can reject the null hypothesis that the mu = 1500. We can also note that a p-value of .04168 is relatively close to the threshold of .05, 
thus we can reject the Null Hypothesis with a grain of salt.
Taking the overall data set for PSI shows a p-value of .06028 which is only marginally above the threshold of .05. The value does lead us to accept the null hypothesis that the mu = 1500 but without great confidence thus leaving us with a bit of doubt.

Analyzing the variance of each individual lot shows that Lot1 has almost no variance with its value at 0.98, indicating the data is very closely distributed to the mean of 1500.
Lot 2 shows a modest variance of 7.47 while lot3 shows the greatest variance of 170, represeting a dataset most scattered from the mean value of 1500.
Taking into consideration the entire datset shows a variance of 62.29 and we know the majority of this variance originates from Lot3.

Looking at the range of PSI in Lot3, we can see PSI values from 1452-1542, representing 48 lower than the mean at the low end and 42 above the mean at the high end of the range. 
Since the manufacturer wants to ensure that the variance of the coils do not exceed 100 pounds, we can confidently say based on the range and the variance itself that we are confident the coils will not exceed the 100 pounds limitation.

Statistical Study Design

As a proper extension from the the statistical analysis performed on the MechaCar prototype, it is proper due diligence to compare not only the dataset of our prototype in a vaccum but among the competition to see how it ranks overall in the marketplace.
Thus the first step of running this study is to identify all the relevant competitors that MechaCar will be competing against once it is fully live in production. 
As we know this is a car that is focused on MPG, we can eliminate those car manufacturers that are producing electric only vehicles e.g. Tesla. We can also eliminate any electric model of car that is produced by any car manufacturer e.g. I3 from BMW.
Further more we will focus to create an apples to apples examination and thus will not be interested in reviewing the data points for trucks, boats, planes, tiny cars, motorcycles - we will find comparable vehicles to MechaCar in length, size, and type and strictly compare models in that set.

We will adhere to statistical conventions to optimize our dataset and reduce the skew and bias as much as possible. For instance, the larger the dataset we have to work on the better conclusions 
we can draw and higher confidence we can have in that data sample. We are aware that getting 100% of the population from each model of car compared is not possible, but understand that a large enough 
sample is required to run statistically significant tests. Abiding by commonly accepted parameters in the statistical community, we will analyze no fewer than 30 different comparable vehicles and obtain no fewer than 30 different instances of that particular model.
As we are introducing a new model into the marketplace with MechaCar, we will only accept other models that are 1 year old in the make Year i.e. no cars from past years or generations will be allowed in the sample. This will allow for a current view of the current generation 
of cars and not compare with older years occurring in a potentially drastically different economy than that of today. Likewise the experiment will focus exclusively on the number of sales of that make for a 12 month period following it's release.
Furthermore, the particular models analyzed will not be chosen with any selection bias and will be randomly selected using a random number generator to selec the specific instances of that make and model that is part of our set.
Just as our data with MechaCar represented vehicles that were produced from 3 different lots, we will also require that the data sample acquired from each manufacturer will be representative of the various lots that each Manufacturer has.
Since we are focused on releasing the MechaCar in the United States, all the data obtained related to the make, model, and sales of the cars will be focused on data acquired in the United States.
It is important that we do all we can to ensure the data is qualified and represents a normal distribution as the tests performed expected the data to display normal distribution properties.

Once we have identified the specific models to analyze, the next step is to identify the various data points to research.

Response Variable (Y):
Number of units sold 

Variables of Interest (X)- Why they are of interest to a consumer?
Miles Per Gallon (MPG) - Gas cost is the number one ongoing cost associated with owning a car aside from maintenance. Consumers are greatly concerned not only with cost of gas but also the level of pollution created by their burning of fuel.
Cruise Control? - Given long distance trips, consumers rely on cruise control to avoid speeding violations. It is also a feature that many consumers may expect to have in a new car purchase in 2021.
Number of Doors - Here we would compare 2 and 4 door vehicles, family buyers may prefer 4 door vehicles while performance and sports oriented consumer may prefer a 2 door.
Make - Is this perhaps the most important variable of all - the make of the vehicle itself? It will be interesting to know if make alone accounts for the strongest correlation with number of vehicles sold. Lots of consumers only make big purchases like a car from a trusted brand and many remain loyal to that brand.
Trim of Car  - Types may include aluminum, chrome, or timber. It will be enlightening to understand if trim plays a factor in the decision making process, if it does not, perhaps MechaCar can avoid having to manufacturer different types of trim and still maintain sales.
Body Type -  Types may include cope, sedan, convertible, hatchback, and wagon. Understanding the top body types a consumer prefers will influence the manufacturing process for MechaCar. 
Length - Some drivers living in congested cities may prefer shorter vehicles, while those living in more mountaineous regions may prefer longer vehicles. Perhaps there are lengths that are too short or long that result in far fewer number of sales.
Weight - Weight influences the safety level of the car. Cars that are too light may not be thought of as safe enough in case of an accident. On the other hand, cars that are too heavy may be considered sluggish and gas guzzlers.
Cylinders - The more cylinders a car has the more power a car can produce. Cylinder levels may include 4,6, and 8. The data will reveal how much a buyer cars, perhaps so long as there is a minimal threshold of cylinders, such as 4, sales are not impacted.
Enginer Size (Liters) -  The more cylinders generally produce more power while the fewer number of cylinders results in better fuel economy. 
Horse Power - Measure of the power produced by the engine which relates to speed of the car. Some consumers may require a certain amount of HP to make a purchase.
Leather - In general the consumer associated leather with a high class vehicle, though perhaps the data reveals that more sales are for cars without leather due to lower cost.
Upgraded Sound System - Allows the user to have an enhanced driving experience by listening to high quality sound such as Bose or Harman Kardan. Though is this factor significant enough to influence the purhcase?
Sports Package? - Depending on the user's life situation (family or single) and location (city or rural) spors package may or may not influence the numbe of sales.
Sunroof - Allows another ability for the user to get fresh air into the car. Also allows for direct sun or moonlight to enter the vehicle - some users may expect this feature.

Question of the Study:
How do the 15 factors (variables) listed above influence the number of units of that particular make and model sold in the 12 month period following it's release?

Type of Tests:
Multiple Regression 
Linear Regression 
Pearson's Correlation Test

Null Hypothesis
Multiple Regression: There are no statistically significant relations among the number of car units sold and all the variables of interest
Linear Regression: There is no statistically significant relation between the number of car units sold and each individual variable of interest
Pearson's: Correleation coefficient is not significantly different from 0

Alternative Hypothesis
Multiple Regression: There are statistically significant relations among the number of car units sold and all the variables of interest
Linear Regression: There is a statistically significant relation between the number of car units sold and each individual variable of interest
Pearson's: Correleation coefficient is significantly different from 0

p-value significance level:
Since the results of this experiment will dictate the design of MechaCar, decisions that represent a lot of time and money, We will set the p-value at the high value of .01, indicating a 99% of drawing accurate conclusions from that results, and only 1% chance of being wrong. 

How to evaluate H0 and HA?
Running the linear and multiple linear regresion tests as described above will yield various p-values for each test. We will check the p-values against the stated threshold of .01, any p-value under .01 will allow us to 
confidently reject the null hypothesis and accept the alternative hypothesis.

The outputs of each Pearson's Correlation Test will yield a Pearson's Correlation coefficient r. Using the absolute value of r for each test and referencing the following table:

Absolute Value of r 	Strength of Correlation
r < 0.3 	               None or very weak
0.3 ≤ r < 0.5 	          Weak
0.5 ≤ r < 0.7 	          Moderate
r ≥ 0.7 	               Strong

We will be able to determine the strength of correlation for every variable of interest as it relates to the number of units sold. 
We will be interested to know which variable demonstrate at least Moderate but primarily strong correlation in order to reject the null hypothesis. For correlations that indicate very weak or weak correlation, that will allow us to accept the null hypothesis that r is effectively no differnet from 0.
